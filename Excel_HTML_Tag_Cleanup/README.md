# Hex Breaker Tech - FROM_VBA_TO_OFFICESCRIPT
## Removing HTML Tags in Excel sheet

Welcome to Hex Breaker Tech, where we shatter the most stubborn tech hexes in the world of automation! 
In this project repository we have a source VBA code that's been transformed by magic that transcends the boundaries of inefficient laziness. 

We also have transference sigil in place and the Office Script that was returned as an end result.
One simply needs to open an Excel file in their Office 365 Cloud sphere to activate the sigil and build the summoning ground for the Office Script automation.
